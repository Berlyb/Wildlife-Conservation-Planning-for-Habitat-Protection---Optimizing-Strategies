# Wildlife Conservation Planning for Habitat Protection - Optimizing-Strategies

ðŸŒ± Biodiversity Conservation Optimization Project
This project focuses on developing an optimization framework to maximize biodiversity impact while adhering to budget constraints over a 10-year period. The approach incorporates stochastic modeling, scenario reduction, and advanced optimization techniques.

ðŸš€ Project Overview
Conserving biodiversity is critical for maintaining ecological balance. This project tackles the challenge of selecting the best conservation strategies within budget limits by leveraging:

Stochastic Modeling: Simulating variability in costs and impacts across multiple scenarios.

Scenario Reduction: Simplifying stochastic scenarios using clustering techniques.

Optimization: Developing a mathematical model to maximize biodiversity impact while managing costs.


ðŸ›  Key Features
Stochastic Scenario Generation
Simulates variability in costs and biodiversity impacts to create realistic scenarios.

Scenario Reduction
Uses KMeans clustering to condense stochastic scenarios into manageable clusters for optimization.

Mathematical Optimization
Maximizes biodiversity impact while staying within dynamic budget constraints.

ðŸ“Š Key Graphs and Insights
